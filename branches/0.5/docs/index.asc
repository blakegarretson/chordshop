Chordshop Documentation Overview
================================

Introduction
------------
Chordshop in general is fairly well documented.  The program usage is rather self-explanatory,
so little documentation is given for the actual interface.  The focus of the documentation is on
the file formats and general program issues such as configuration and installation.
