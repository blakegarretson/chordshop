Chordshop FAQ
=============

Why free?
    "Without payment you have received; without payment you are to give." (Mat 10:8 ISV)

Why is the binary version of Chordshop so big??
    FIXME

I found a bug.  What should I do??
    Send an email to 'blakeg at freeshell.org' detailing the problem.

Could you add Feature X??
    Short answer: No.  Long answer: I 'could', but don't hold your breath.
    Check the todo list.  If it is not on there, then I probably won't do it any
    time soon.  Chordshop generally does what I want it to, but if you want to add
    a feature, go right ahead.  That's why Chordshop is open source.
