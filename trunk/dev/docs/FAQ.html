Why free?

<p><em>
Why is the binary version of Chordshop so big
</em></p>
<p>
    FIXME

<li>
<p><em>
I found a bug.  What should I do
</em></p>
<p>
    Send an email to <em>blakeg at freeshell.org</em> detailing the problem.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>
Could you add Feature X
</em></p>
<p>
    Short answer: No.  Long answer: I <em>could</em>, but don't hold your breath.
    Check the todo list.  If it is not on there, then I probably won't do it any
    time soon.  Chordshop generally does what I want it to, but if you want to add
    a feature, go right ahead.  That's why Chordshop is open source.
