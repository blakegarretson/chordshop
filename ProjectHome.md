Chordshop produces high quality PDF chord sheets and songbooks. It uses the general ChordPro format and adds some extensions of its own. These extensions allow for advanced features like the support of measures, on-the-fly transposition, and dual chord lines to show capoed chords along with the actual chords. It also provides a handy GUI to aid in the editing of ChordPro files and the creation of chord diagrams.

**This project is currently on indefinite hold until I have time to resume it. I was in middle of a source rewrite, so the project and GUI is kind of messy at the moment, although the code is still here if you want to try the program.  I took the website, blog, and group forum all offline due to frequent emails harassing me about finishing this project, making binary downloads, etc.  Right now my three kids are a higher priority than my hobbies and side projects I started before I had kids. :)**
