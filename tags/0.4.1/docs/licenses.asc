License Overview
----------------
Free use of Chordshop is granted under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
See the GPL.txt license file in the distributed package for details.

You can download Chordshop in two forms:

- Python Chordshop
  * This is the "source package", but it can also be run as is.
- Windows Chordshop
  * This is a standalone binary package that comes with all of the prerequisites included.
  * If you want the source, download the Python Source package as well.

Both versions of Chordshop (which use the same source) are Copyright 2004 Blake T. Garretson
and are released under the GNU GPL.

Most of the great looking toolbar icons (new, save, open, etc.) in both versions of Chordshop
are Copyright 2003 by Ximian, Inc, and are available under the LGPL.  See
http://developer.ximian.com/themes/[http://developer.ximian.com/themes/] for details
and downloads.

Windows Chordshop comes with the prerequisites included, so I should include their
copyrights and licenses as well. Here is their info:

- wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org[http://www.wxpython.org])
  * Copyright (c) 1998 Julian Smart, Robert Roebling et al
  * wxPython is a wrapper for wxWindows (recently renamed wxWidgets), and therefore
    ships with the wxWindows license.  It basically uses the GNU LGPL, with an exception.
    See the wxWindows.txt license file in the license directory
    of the Chordshop distribution.  It also references the LGPL, which is included in this
    distribution as LGPL.txt.
